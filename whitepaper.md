## Introduction

Amaya Token ($AMAYAONE) powers the Amaya Ecosystem — a suite of lifestyle, utility, and community applications designed to promote active living, meaningful participation, and sustainable digital engagement.

The ecosystem initially operates on Web2 infrastructure, with a clear roadmap toward Web3 integration to enhance transparency, decentralization, and on-chain utility.

## Ecosystem Integration

### 1. MOVE+
MOVE+ enables users to earn Energy Points through walking or running. These Energy Points can be converted into Amaya Tokens or redeemed for items and services through ecosystem-supported marketplaces.

### 2. Amaya Marketplace
The Amaya Marketplace is a digital platform designed to support creators, partners, and communities by enabling token-based rewards, subscriptions, and engagement-driven interactions.

The marketplace emphasizes transparency, creator empowerment, and sustainable participation within the Amaya Ecosystem.

## Amaya Token (AMAYAONE)

Amaya Token ($AMAYAONE) serves as the core utility token for all applications operating under the Amaya Ecosystem.

It is built on the Solana blockchain as an SPL token, ensuring speed, scalability, and low transaction costs.

### Token Details

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Token Name | Amaya Token |
| Ticker | $AMAYAONE |
| Total Supply | 100,000,000 (100M) |
| Network | Solana |
| Type | SPL Token |

## Controlled Circulating Supply

Out of the 100M total token supply:
- **40%** will enter circulation in the early phase
- **60%** remains locked for future ecosystem growth

This approach ensures controlled distribution, reduced volatility, and long-term sustainability.

### Benefits
- Prevents early inflation and excessive sell pressure
- Builds trust through structured and transparent token release
- Preserves flexibility for future ecosystem expansion

### Supply Breakdown

| Status | Percentage | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Circulating (available) | 40% | Includes presale, liquidity, and early ecosystem rewards |
| Locked (vesting) | 60% | Gradual unlock over 1–3 years |

> Only 40% of the total supply will be circulating at launch. The remaining supply is locked to support long-term growth and stability.

## Token Allocation

| Category | % | Lock / Vesting | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Presale | 5% | None | Initial support and seed funding |
| Liquidity Pool | 10% | Locked 1–2 years | Market stability and pairing |
| Community Rewards / MOVE+ | 20% | Emission 1–2% monthly | Earned through activity and community participation |
| Developer Allocation | 10% | 3-month cliff, 2-year vesting | Development and maintenance |
| Marketing | 5% | 3–6 months | Campaigns, partnerships, and adoption |
| Ecosystem & Partnerships | 48% | Locked 1 year, vesting 3 years | Expansion, integrations, and collaborations |
| Social Impact Fund | 2% | 6–12 months | Community programs and public-good initiatives |

## Burn Mechanism

10% of total ecosystem-generated revenue is allocated for **quarterly token burns**.

This mechanism supports:
- Supply deflation
- Long-term value sustainability
- Alignment between ecosystem usage and token economics

---

## Simplified Roadmap

- **Q4 2025** – Early Supporter & Investor Registration  
- **January 2026** – MOVE+ Presale Launch  
- **Q1 2026** – MOVE+ App Official Launch (with ecosystem rewards)  
- **Q2 2026** – Amaya Marketplace Expansion  
- **Q3–Q4 2026** – Web3 Integration Research & Ecosystem Scaling  

---

## Transparency & Lock Policy

All locked tokens are secured via audited smart contract lockers (e.g., Team Finance or Vesting.sol).

- Unlocks follow a predefined quarterly schedule
- Recommended vesting: **10–15% unlock per quarter after a 6-month cliff**
- Designed to protect ecosystem stability and participant confidence

---

## Revenue Flow

Ecosystem Earnings →  
**10% Burn Fund** + **1–2% Social Impact Fund** →  
Transparency Wallets

This structure ensures sustainability, accountability, and long-term alignment.
